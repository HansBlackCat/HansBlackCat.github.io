This blog is for recording my programming experiences, and sharing personally interesting stuffs about programming. I’m not a native English speaker, so some expressions can be quite awkward. If you find ones, please feel free to correct me (Accents, grammars, programming styles or whatever) It’s been a year and quarter, since I started programming. I means, It’s NOT to say “Okay, I’m newby, so you guys shall not blame me or correct me” I promise to try my best to post correct and desirable code, but there may (well, MUST) be errors on my code. Same as above, feel free to tell me in English or Korean. Let me tell you more about me. I’m majoring in Earth Sciende &amp; Education. I’m college student now. Because of many legacy code, our college mainly use fortran or Matlab code for programming. I’m not actually good at fortran, but our professors, and some graduated student use fortran well. Maybe later? There will be some chances to post fortran codes. But not now. For now, I want to focus on C++, Haskell, Math, or general CS knowledge.","link":"/2021/04/01/base/"},{"title":"Base2","text":"","link":"/2021/04/01/base2/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Etc","slug":"Etc","link":"/tags/Etc/"}],"categories":[]}
